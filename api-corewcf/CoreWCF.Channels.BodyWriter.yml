  summary: Represents the writer of the message body.
  remarks: "A message consists of headers and a body. The headers are buffered and the body is streamed. Because the body is streamed, the user cannot pass the actual content of the body to a message. Instead the user must pass a class that knows how to write the body when asked to do so. This is done by passing a class derived from <xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter> to the <xref:CoreWCF.Channels.Message>. A message calls the class derived from <xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter> whenever it requires the body to be written using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>.  \n\n\n\n"

  remarks: A class derived from <xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter> can override this method to create a buffered copy of the <xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter>. But the default implementation of [WriteBodyContents(XmlDictionaryWriter)](xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter.WriteBodyContents(System.Xml.XmlDictionaryWriter)) calls [OnWriteBodyContents(XmlDictionaryWriter)](xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter.OnWriteBodyContents(System.Xml.XmlDictionaryWriter)), so overriding just [OnWriteBodyContents(XmlDictionaryWriter)](xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter.OnWriteBodyContents(System.Xml.XmlDictionaryWriter)) should be easier and work for most scenarios.<br/><br/>
           Note that the [BodyWriter](xref:CoreWCF.Channels.BodyWriter) returned must be buffered, that is IsBuffered must be true.
